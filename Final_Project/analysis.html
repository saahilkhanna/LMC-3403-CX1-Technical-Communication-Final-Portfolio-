                        When I look back at the "Letter to the Instructor" I wrote at the start of the semester, my goals were clear: become more concise as a writer, design more engaging and effective communication materials (especially slides and visuals), and build a professional portfolio that could support my career in technical fields. I also connected these goals to my broader professional development by committing to interview preparation and LeetCode practice. From the beginning, I was aligning myself with the course learning outcomes in rhetoric, process, modes & media, and design, thinking about how to present myself persuasively to employers, and planning artifacts that would be useful beyond the classroom.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the semester, my work in LMC 3403 has helped me make concrete progress on each of these goals. In Major Project 1, I iterated extensively on my resume and cover letter for Software Engineering positions, refining wording, organization, and visual hierarchy so that they spoke directly to specific job descriptions rather than functioning as generic documents. Major Projects 2 and 3 gave me the chance to design communication for broader communities, first by analyzing how scientific crises are communicated to the public (the J&J vaccine pause), and later by building a technical communication toolkit for the Georgia Tech Library that made their resources more discoverable to students.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the same time, I also followed through on the professional-development side of my goals. I not only reached my revised target of 75 LeetCode questions but ultimately completed 150, which demonstrates sustained effort and discipline beyond the minimum I set for myself. The resume I created, I use it for applications, same with the cover letter and portfolio. I believe my growth this semester sets up a strong argument that I have met the expectations for an A in this course, but let's explore why I think so below:

                            Rhetorically, I have repeatedly framed my technical expertise for different audiences and contexts across all three major projects. I've learned to analyze what each audience needs and adapt my communication accordingly, whether that's recruiters scanning resumes, the general public trying to understand vaccine safety, or students rushing to print before class.

                            <li><strong>MP3:</strong> Designed materials around specific student needs and situations, like last-minute printing or confusion about study spaces, rather than just listing library services. We made conscious choices about language, tone, and design so materials would be skimmable and accessible to both students and library staff.</li>

                            Process-wise, I can point to multiple projects where I moved through drafting, feedback, and substantial revision. My approach to revision and openness to adaptability allowed for strategic refinements that strengthened my deliverables significantly.

                            <li><strong>MP1:</strong> Iterated heavily on both content and design of my application materials. For example, my cover letter was too generic, using placeholders like "[Company Name]" weakening the rhetorical impact. I revised to target a specific position with actual company details, demonstrating audience awareness and genuine interest.</li>
                            <li><strong>MP2:</strong> Coordinated with my partner Mokshith through shared documents and group chat, revising our poster based on peer feedback. We started with researching broadly the COVID-19 communication and then iterated to the specific J&J vaccine pause, which strengthened our argument and reduced the scope allowing us to sufficiently cover a topic in-depth within the 10 minutes allotted to present. We went through research → feedback → research again → poster design → poster final → presentation script → presentation completion.</li>
                            <li><strong>MP3:</strong> Made several meaningful changes based on feedback: removed unnecessary arrows pointing to QR codes (they cluttered the design), expanded the printing section to explain zone information more clearly, and revised our recommendation report because we had originally assumed audience familiarity with the assignment.</li>

                            Throughout the semester, I drew on design principles to create artifacts that used layout, typography, and visuals to support rather than distract from the message. I've grown significantly in my ability to balance visual appeal with accessibility and functionality.

                            Based on the course description and learning outcomes in the syllabus, A-level work in LMC 3403 demonstrates consistent excellence in technical communication across rhetoric, process, modes & media, and design, as well as strong engagement with the theme of "Community Science." I believe my work meets those criteria. I have maintained strong attendance and participation, I have not missed class, and have consistently contributed to discussions and peer reviews (even while managing the physical challenge of walking to class with a torn ACL).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also want to be honest about where I fell short. The biggest gap between my initial goals and my final portfolio is that I did not complete the standalone portfolio website I originally planned as a separate project. While I improved my GitHub presence and created this portfolio site, the dedicated professional website remains unfinished (I have been working through but the PROCESS and DESIGN is quite arduous and time consuming). My shortcoming is not due to lack of interest, but to a conscious decision about scope and priorities: given the demands of multiple major projects, my other coursework, and my professional goals, I chose to focus on making the artifacts for MP1, MP2, and MP3 as strong and rhetorically effective as possible.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Regardless, my consistent engagement, my growth across all four learning outcome areas, my extensive iteration on major projects, and my honest reflection on where I still need to grow, I feel confident in making the case that I have earned an A in LMC 3403.

                    <p>
                        This semester has fundamentally improved how I think about technical communication. The skills I've developed, audience analysis, iterative revision, multimodal design, and visual communication, are directly applicable to my career in software engineering. Every technical document I write, every presentation I give, every piece of code I document will benefit from the awareness I've built in this course.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        More importantly, I've learned that effective communication is about timing and context as much as content, putting the right information in the right format, in the right place, matters just as much as what the message actually says. This insight will guide my work as a technical communicator, whether I'm writing API documentation, presenting research findings, or collaborating with teams to solve complex problems in the future.
